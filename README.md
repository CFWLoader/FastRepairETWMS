### A last homework for Software Architecture. Hail to Mr.Deng.

Requirement of Mr.Deng seems focus on documents for this project, not the product.<br/>
So our team may make less effort on coding while we make more effort on making documents.<br/>
I punch in github by committing this project.<br/>
And the level of project seems low in your evaluation.
